 - Counters from 0 to n-1.
 - n will be a non-negative value.
 - Last line in the file will contain a 0.
 - First Operation: Print the counters in ascending counter value. Linear.
 - Second Operation: Print the counters in ascending index value. Linear.
 - Third Operation: Add one to the counter indexed by i. O(log n).
 - Fourth Operation: Substract from the counter indexed by i. O(log n).
 - Fifth Operation: (i,j) Determine number of arguments where counters>=i & counters<=j

	
	Let's say n = 5
	The map[] array will be used to get to a certain position in the column.
